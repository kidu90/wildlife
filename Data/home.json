One explanation for this is that because there are larger predators around, leopards tend to hide more. In Sri Lanka The IUCN Red List of 2007 listed the leopard as endangered because of the decline in the leopard population in Sri Lanka. Poaching and the loss of leopard habitat brought on by conflicts between humans and leopards are the causes of the decline.",
